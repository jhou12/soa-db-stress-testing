// CLI COPY INTO EC2

fyi: to view ec2 avail memory use df -h

cd into ec2 root (up 2 levels)

log into super user with sudo su:
create csv dir to copy
chmod 777 csv dir

copy from local to ec2:
scp -i "[pem key]" [abs path]/*.csv ubuntu@[public ipv4 dns]:/[csv ec2 dir]

sudo -u postgres psql and manually copy each into db with
COPY "AllUrls" FROM '/csvs/pg[LOOP].csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

delete csvs to make room with :
sudo su
rm -R [csv dir]

and then create index with:
CREATE INDEX "primaryQuery" ON "AllUrls"("assocId");

test with:
select * from "AllUrls" where "assocId"=1000
